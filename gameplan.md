Visualising the feature map of CNNs

How does attention work for CNNs ?

Transfer learning and fine-tuning? (Resnet)

Autoencoder: An autoencoder learns efficient codings of unlabeled data

Variational autoencoder (VAE) 
Here, the latent space is not a fixed point anymore. It is a value sampled from a (gaussian) distribution with a learned mean and standard deviation.


Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)


Diffusion
